        deal.II finite element library towards exascale readiness. Building upon
        the foundations laid in D1.2, this deliverable focuses on the
        consolidation of the new features, their integration into real-world
        biomedical applications, and preliminary scaling tests on EuroHPC
        pre-exascale systems. Major achievements include significant
        improvements in GPU matrix-free solvers, the stabilization and extension
        of the generalized interface for coupling operators, the maturation of
        the polygonal discretization module, and the integration of external
        solver technologies (PSCToolkit and MUMPS) into the deal.II workflow. }

\section{{Introduction}}

The goal of Work Package 1 (WP1) is to strengthen the numerical and software backbone of the dealii-X Centre of Excellence by extending the capabilities of the deal.II library, enabling the exascale transition of digital twins for human organs. Deliverable D1.4 provides a consolidated report on the technical progress, following the preliminary results described in D1.2, and emphasizes integration, benchmarking, and readiness for multiphysics biomedical applications.

\subsection{{Purpose of the Document}}

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements made in the deal.II library as part of the dealii-X project. It aims to inform stakeholders about the current state of the library, the challenges encountered, and the strategies employed to overcome them.

\subsection{Polygonal Discretization Methods (WP1.3)}

The Polydeal module has been further developed, enriched with a suite of test cases and benchmark applications. The R-tree agglomeration (R3MG) has been successfully applied to generate multigrid hierarchies in large brain poromechanics simulations, confirming its robustness and scalability. Work is ongoing to merge the module into the official deal.II repository, including comprehensive documentation and tutorials.

\subsection{Challenges and Future Plans}

Key challenges remain in achieving uniform GPU performance across architectures (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel), minimizing data movement overheads, and ensuring robust interoperability between deal.II and external solvers. Future efforts will focus on:

Finalizing the integration of polygonal methods and external solver backends into the main deal.II release.

Conducting large-scale benchmarks on organ applications (brain poromechanics, liver hemodynamics).

Preparing training materials and tutorials for the broader deal.II community.
