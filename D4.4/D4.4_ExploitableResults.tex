\section{{Introduction}} \label{sec:introduction}

The CoE dealii-X project, titled ``Exascale Framework for Digital Twins of the Human Body'', seeks to transform computational methods in medical science by developing a high-performance exascale computing framework. Using the deal.II library, it aims to create highly detailed digital twins of human organs, enabling real-time simulations of complex biological processes.

The project follows a separation-of-concerns approach, with different components managed by specialized teams to meet the needs of various domain experts. Key efforts include optimizing deal.II for exascale performance by improving core computational algorithms, enhancing node-level efficiency, and addressing challenges like scalable linear algebra routines and efficient mesh handling. Additionally, it focuses on co-designing for emerging HPC architectures, ensuring energy efficiency and maximizing hardware capabilities.

Beyond technical advancements, community engagement, training, and knowledge dissemination play a crucial role, fostering collaboration within the HPC ecosystem. The project is organized into five work packages (WPs) covering method and algorithmic development, modeling, computation, validation, and dissemination.

The consortium assembled for this project brings together a diverse and complementary range of expertise, facilities, and experiences necessary to achieve the ambitious objectives of the project. Each participating institution contributes unique strengths that collectively form a robust and interdisciplinary team capable of tackling the complex challenges of exascale computing and digital twin development. The related key exploitable results from WPs 1 to 3 are summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:exploitable_results_WP1}, \ref{tab:exploitable_results_WP2}, ~\ref{tab:exploitable_results_WP3} and~\ref{tab:exploitable_results_WP4}.
